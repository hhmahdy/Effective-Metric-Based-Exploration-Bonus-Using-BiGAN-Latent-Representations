# Install the ORIGINAL Unity Noisy-TV environment of
# `luchris429/noisy-tv-env` -- "The Noisy TV Environment from Large-Scale Study
# of Curiosity-Driven Learning (ICLR 2019)" -- so that the training pipeline can
# run it as `NoisyTVUnity-v0` instead of the pure-python reconstruction
# (`NoisyTVMaze-v0`).
#
# Three things are needed, and the upstream repository only ships the first two:
#
#   1. the `unityagents` python client, vendored in that repository
#      (it is not on PyPI, which is why this script clones the repository),
#   2. `pillow`, because the client decodes the frames the player sends,
#   3. the player executable itself, which that project distributes out of band
#      through a Google Drive folder linked from its README.
#
# This script performs (1) and (2) automatically, then tries (3) with `gdown`
# when the folder is reachable; if the download fails (Google Drive rate-limits
# and blocks automated access regularly) it prints exactly where to put the
# build by hand. Everything lands in `third_party/noisy-tv-env`, which the
# adapter searches automatically (see environments/noisy_tv_unity.py).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/install_noisy_tv_unity.sh
#   VENV=/path/to/venv DOWNLOAD=0 bash scripts/install_noisy_tv_unity.sh
#
# Configurable variables (defaults in brackets):
#   VENV           []            virtualenv to install `pillow`/`gdown` into
#   PYTHON         [python3]     interpreter used when VENV is unset
#   DESTINATION    [third_party/noisy-tv-env]
#   DRIVE_FOLDER   [1fFzDrs78teoBXtuUHJT6bvUN6MSoL_Dc]  upstream build folder
#   DOWNLOAD       [1]           attempt the Google Drive download

The python client is installed, but the player executable is still missing.

The build is NOT distributed through git; that project publishes it in the
Google Drive folder linked from its README:

  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/${DRIVE_FOLDER}

Download the archive for your platform, extract it, and place the executable
(for Linux, the file whose name ends in .x86_64) here:

  ${PLAYER_DIR}/tv_maze.x86_64

or anywhere else and point the adapter at it:

  export NOISY_TV_UNITY_BINARY=/path/to/tv_maze          # path without the suffix
  python main.py --env NoisyTVUnity-v0 ...

Until then the pipeline keeps using the pure-python reconstruction of the same
maze (NoisyTVMaze-v0), which needs neither the player nor a display.
