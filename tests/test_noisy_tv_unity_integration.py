"""Integration tests for the original Unity Noisy-TV path.

The reference environment is a Unity application: its python side is the
``unityagents`` client vendored in ``luchris429/noisy-tv-env``, and the player
is a separate executable that the client launches as
``tv_maze[.x86_64] --port <port>`` before speaking a JSON-plus-JPEG protocol
over a TCP socket. The player binary itself is distributed out of band and is
therefore frequently unavailable (no network access to Google Drive, no GPU, no
display).

These tests exercise the *whole python half of that path for real*: they start
the genuine upstream client, which binds a socket, launches a player process
and decodes the frames it receives. The player process is
``tests/fixtures/fake_tv_maze_player.py``, extracted to a temporary directory as
``tv_maze.x86_64`` so that the client's Linux launch logic finds it exactly as
it would find the Unity build. Only the Unity engine is simulated; the client,
the socket protocol, the launch semantics, the JPEG decoding, the adapter, and
the noisy-television behaviour are the real thing.

The tests skip cleanly when the upstream client or ``pillow`` is missing; run
``bash scripts/install_noisy_tv_unity.sh`` to install them (it also downloads
the real player when Google Drive is reachable).
